## 1. **Bitcoin (BTC)** â€“ The Original Cryptocurrency  
Launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, **Bitcoin (BTC)** remains the most recognizable cryptocurrency. As the first decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.

### How Bitcoin Works  
Bitcoin operates on a **proof-of-work (PoW)** consensus mechanism, where miners validate transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. Each transaction is recorded on a transparent, immutable ledger called the blockchain. Users secure their BTC using private keys, ensuring ownership remains anonymous yet verifiable.

### Key Features  
- **Max Supply**: 21 million coins  
- **Use Case**: Digital gold, store of value  
- **Market Cap**: Dominates ~40% of the crypto market

Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is more than a cryptocurrencyâ€”itâ€™s a decentralized platform for building **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (dApps)**.

### Ethereumâ€™s Unique Value  
The Ethereum blockchain supports programmable money through **smart contracts**, self-executing agreements that automate transactions. This functionality powers decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 innovations.

### Key Features  
- **Consensus**: Transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022  
- **Gas Fees**: Users pay ETH to execute network operations  
- **Market Cap**: Second-largest after Bitcoin

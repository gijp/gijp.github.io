## What Makes Uniswap a DeFi Pioneer?  

Uniswap is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol built on the **Ethereum blockchain**, enabling seamless token swaps without intermediaries. Unlike traditional exchanges that rely on order books, Uniswap uses **liquidity pools** where users contribute assets to facilitate trading. These pools are governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and eliminating reliance on centralized entities.  

Key features of Uniswap include:  
- **ERC-20 Compatibility**: Supports trading of Ethereum-based tokens like ETH, BAT, and OMG.  
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Charges a 0.3% fee on trades, which is distributed to liquidity providers.  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Operates autonomously via smart contracts, reducing counterparty risks.

# The Emergence of Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) Through EigenLayer

## Understanding EigenLayer and Restaking

EigenLayer introduces a groundbreaking DeFi primitive to Ethereum staking through the concept of **restaking**. This innovation allows stakers to participate in multiple protocols, known as **Actively Validated Services (AVS)**, while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network. Users can either natively restake their node or leverage **Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)** like sfrxETH, rETH, or stETH. By doing so, they extend crypto-economic security to additional AVS on Ethereum, unlocking extra rewards and fostering ecosystem innovation.

### EigenLayer: A Restaking Middleware

EigenLayer operates as a restaking middleware on Ethereum, enabling consensus layer ETH stakers to validate new software modules built atop the Ethereum ecosystem. By opting into additional slashing conditions, stakers enhance security while gaining access to new revenue streams. EigenLayer's architecture supports modules like L2 consensus protocols, data availability layers, and virtual machines, addressing Ethereum's fragmented security challenge. This aggregation of ETH security across modules optimizes Proof of Stake capital efficiency, allowing innovators to deploy distributed validation systems without building trust networks from scratch.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Pooled Security**: Aggregates ETH security across AVSs.
- **Free-Market Governance**: Creates an open marketplace for AVSs to rent security from Ethereum validators.

## Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) vs. Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)

While both LSTs and LRTs originate from EigenLayer, they serve distinct purposes.

### Illiquidity of LSTs
When **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)** are locked on EigenLayer, they become illiquid. This restricts their use in DeFi, as they cannot be traded or used as collateral.

### Liquidity Solution Through LRTs
**Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)** address this limitation by unlocking staked tokens' liquidity. Instead of depositing LSTs directly into EigenLayer, stakers can use a Liquid Restaking protocolâ€”similar to platforms like Lidoâ€”to maintain liquidity while participating in restaking.

## Core Advantages of LRTs

Beyond liquidity, LRTs offer transformative benefits:
- **Higher Yields**: Leverage additional yield layers for stakers.
- **Governance Aggregation**: Protocols or DAOs handle restaking, eliminating manual validator management.
- **Compounding Yields**: Gas fees are reduced, and yield optimization is automated.
- **Risk Diversification**: Delegation across multiple AVS operators minimizes single-point failure risks.

## Risks Associated With Restaking

Despite their potential, LRTs and EigenLayer restaking introduce systemic risks:

### Smart Contract Risks
EigenLayer's smart contracts grant withdrawal rights to staked ETH. Coding vulnerabilities could lead to collateral loss.

### Rehypothecation Risks
Restaked ETH secures multiple protocols simultaneously. A failure in one validator could cascade across the ecosystem.

### Underwriting Risks
Validators selecting protocols to secure face slashing risks if they validate malicious systems.

### Malicious Validator Risks
Colluding validators could compromise the security of AVS protocols they secure.

## Vitalik Buterinâ€™s Concerns on Restaking

In a May 2023 post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted systemic risks from dual-use staking (including restaking). Key concerns include:

- **Complexity**: Restaking increases validator responsibilities.
- **Community Risk**: The Ethereum community might face disputes over restaked protocols, risking schisms.
- **Scope Expansion**: Expanding Ethereum consensus beyond core functions could lead to bureaucratic control.

### EigenLayer Founderâ€™s Response

Sreeram Kannan, EigenLayerâ€™s founder, acknowledges Vitalikâ€™s concerns and emphasizes cautious implementation to mitigate misuse. The protocol prioritizes safeguards to align with Ethereumâ€™s core philosophy.

## The Future of LRTs and the "LRT Wars"

As EigenLayer transitions from beta to full operation, the "LRT Wars" are anticipated. This competitive landscape will involve LRT protocols vying for dominance, with AVSs leveraging veTokenomics-style strategies to attract restaked ETH. The dynamics could mirror the DeFi Summer of 2020, driving TVL growth and ETH price appreciation through increased leverage.

### Bullish Outlook for LRTs
- **Yield Aggregation**: Higher ETH yields via compounding.
- **DeFi Leverage**: Unlocked liquidity fuels innovation and capital efficiency.

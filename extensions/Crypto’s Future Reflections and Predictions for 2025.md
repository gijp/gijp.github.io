MiCA‚Äôs influence extends beyond Europe, inspiring regulatory dialogues in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Institutions now recognize the need to align with frameworks that balance innovation and consumer protection. For businesses, this means prioritizing compliance strategies that adapt to evolving rules.

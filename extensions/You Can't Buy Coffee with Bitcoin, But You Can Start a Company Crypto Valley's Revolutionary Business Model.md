# You Can't Buy Coffee with Bitcoin, But You Can Start a Company: Crypto Valley's Revolutionary Business Model  

## The Rise of Blockchain Startups in Switzerland  

Switzerland's Crypto Valley has emerged as a global hub for blockchain innovation, with over 60 companies leveraging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to establish their businesses. This unconventional approach bypasses traditional banking systems, allowing entrepreneurs to use digital assets as founding capital. While the concept challenges conventional financial norms, it has gained traction in regions like Zug, NeuchÃ¢tel, and Zurich, where blockchain pioneers are redefining corporate finance.

### How Crypto-Based Company Formation Works  

Swiss law requires companies to have founding capital ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 Swiss Francs, depending on their legal structure. While traditional assets like real estate or cash are standard, cantonal authorities increasingly accept cryptocurrencies as valid capital. This shift has enabled startups to:  

- **Secure funding through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)**  
- **Use Bitcoin or Ethereum as collateral**  
- **Avoid banking restrictions faced by blockchain ventures**  

### Case Study: SwissCrypOne's Banking Struggles  

Bing Voorham, CEO of Zug-based SwissCrypOne, highlights the challenges of traditional finance:  
> "We spent days begging local banks for accounts, but they all refused us. Without Bitcoin, building Crypto Valley would have been extremely difficult."  

This sentiment is echoed across the industry, where blockchain startups often face skepticism from traditional financial institutions.  

## Risks and Rewards of Crypto Capital  

While cryptocurrency offers unprecedented flexibility, its volatility introduces significant risks. For instance:  

| Cryptocurrency | 2017 Peak Price (USD) | 2024 Price (USD) | Value Change |  
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|  
| Bitcoin (BTC)  | $20,000               | $6,900           | -65.5%       |  
| Ethereum (ETH) | $1,400                | $320             | -77.1%       |  

This volatility creates challenges for financial planning and operational stability.  

### Strategic Mitigation Approaches  
1. **Partial Crypto Payments**: Bravis co-founder Simon Leuenberger recommends using crypto for "part of employee salaries" to balance risk.  
2. **Long-term Holding**: Validity Labs' AndrÃ© Wolke notes early ETH purchases at fractions of current prices provide "natural protection against market swings."  
3. **Stablecoin Adoption**: Emerging stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies or commodities promise reduced volatility.

## Key Market Movements  

When Musk altered his X profile in December 2024:  
- **KEKIUS token** surged 3000% from $0.0112 to $0.3891  
- **Pepe Coin (PEPE)** gained 20%, reaching market cap rank #25

This volatility highlights the speculative nature of meme coins - digital assets derived from internet culture rather than technical innovation.  

### Meme Coin Mechanics Explained  

| Token | Inspiration | Blockchain | Max Supply |  
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|  
| KEKIUS | Username "KekiusMaximus" | Ethereum | 1 Billion |  
| PEPE | Pepe the Frog meme | Ethereum | 420.69 Billion |  
| DOGE | Doge meme | Scrypt | Infinite (mined) |  

## Investor Behavior and Market Psychology  

A crypto investor revealed:  
> "I bought 3 million DOGE at $0.41 primarily due to Musk's endorsements. While I diversified into PEPE and KEKIUS, timing market reactions to his actions remains challenging."  

This pattern reflects broader trends:  
1. **Social Proof**: High-profile endorsements create perceived legitimacy  
2. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: Rapid price movements pressure latecomers  
3. **Community Building**: Meme coins foster strong online communities

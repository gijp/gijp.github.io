# 10 Things You Must Know About Bull Markets  

Bull markets captivate investors with their upward trajectory, creating opportunities and challenges alike. Understanding these phases is crucial for navigating financial landscapes effectively. Below, we explore essential insights about bull markets, optimized for clarity and SEO-driven engagement.  

## What Defines a Bull Market?  

A bull market refers to a financial market condition where prices rise consistently over an extended period. While definitions vary among analysts, the most widely accepted criterion involves a **20% increase** in a broad market index like the S&P 500 from its previous trough. This metric distinguishes genuine bull markets from short-lived rallies.  

### Why Is It Called a Bull Market?  

The term "bull market" originates from the way bulls attack by thrusting their horns upward, symbolizing rising prices. Alternative theories link it to historical trading practices or exaggerated sales pitches ("a line of bull"), but the animal metaphor remains the most enduring explanation.  

**FAQ**: *How does a bull market differ from a bear market?*  
A bear market occurs when prices drop by 20% or more from recent highs, reflecting pessimism and declining investor confidence.

## Confirming a Bull Market  

Declaring a bull market requires more than record highs or media speculation. The S&P 500's 20% rebound from its lowest point is a key benchmark. For instance, the current bull market was confirmed on **January 19, 2024**, when the index surpassed its January 3, 2022, closing high. However, some analysts, like Sam Stovall of CFRA, emphasize additional criteria, such as sustained gains over six months without revisiting prior lows.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### 1. What is a blockchain explorer?  
A blockchain explorer is a tool for visualizing and analyzing blockchain data, such as transaction histories, block details, and wallet addresses.  

### 2. How do Ethereum mining rewards work?  
Validators earn rewards through:  
- **Base rewards**: Issued for proposing valid blocks.  
- **Priority fees**: Collected from transaction fees within the block.  

### 3. What determines gas prices on Ethereum?  
Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand. Users set bid prices for transaction inclusion, with higher fees prioritizing faster processing.  

### 4. Why are internal transactions important?  
Internal transactions track value transfers initiated by smart contracts, revealing dApp activity and decentralized finance (DeFi) operations.  

### 5. How does block depth affect security?  
Greater block depth (e.g., 7 million+ blocks) indicates stronger immutability, as altering historical data becomes computationally infeasible.
